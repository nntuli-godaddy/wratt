# wratt 

## The official Github repo for GoDaddy bootcamp's 2025 class. 

### Want to checkout a current branch?

Do this:

- `cd` into whatever directory you want the project folder to be
- `git clone https://github.com/nntuli-godaddy/wratt.git` (SKIP THIS IF YOU ALREADY HAVE `wratt` IN YOUR CURRENT DIRECTORY)
- `cd wratt`
- `ls` to check that your folder is the same as our main repo 
- `git fetch origin`
- `git checkout <INSERT_BRANCH_NAME>`
- This should place you into the specified branch, so do `ls` to check that it matches.
- Explore files/folders you'd like to work on,
- DO BELOW IF YOU WANT TO COMMIT YOUR CHANGES
- To add changes, do `git add <WHATEVER_FOLDER_OR_FILE>` then `git commit -m <MESSAGE>`
- When you're ready, do `git push -u origin <INSERT_BRANCH_NAME` with the same branch name you checked out
- Check the github repo to see your commits

### Creating your own branch? 

Just do it on Github through the dropdown on the left corner. Save yourself the pain. 


### How to contribute?

Use an IDE, PyCharm or VSCode, or even the terminal if you're feeling spicy!

Clone the repo, make sure to add your name and email (these will be done sequentially, not all at once):


`git config --global user.name <YOUR_NAME_HERE>`

`git config --global user.email <YOUR_EMAIL_HERE>`


I prefer VSCode to stage, and commit your changes. If you run into any issues while synching your commit, such as
"local branch has diverged from main" or something like that, do this:

`git pull --rebase`

then try synching again

*if you have any doubts, or would like some guidance, message the group on Slack!!!*
