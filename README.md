## (JAVIER'S BRANCH)

Separate the `frontend` folder and `backend` folder into different terminals for now. 
- `cd frontend` in terminal 1
- `cd backend` in terminal 2
- in terminal 1, do `npm install` then `npm run local`, it should give you the local port to check out
- in terminal 2, do `docker compose up -d`, then check that my tests are good with `docker compose up --build --exit-code-from tests --abort-on-container-exit tests`
- now, you should be able to add and delete shopItems to the cart on the local server.
  
- BONUS: if you want to play with the postgresql database or inspect elements/delete elements, then run `docker compose exec db psql -U bootcamp -d bootcamp` in the `backend` terminal. You should already have the Docker container + images running.
- This will spawn a shell, which you can exit with `exit`
- Now, you can run SQL commands! To list all tables (there should be two, `databaseproducts` and `databasecartitem`), then do `\dt`.
- Slack me if you run into trouble!

List your name and issue below:

### How to contribute?

Use an IDE, PyCharm or VSCode, or even the terminal if you're feeling spicy!

Clone the repo, make sure to add your name and email (these will be done sequentially, not all at once):


`git config --global user.name <YOUR_NAME_HERE>`

`git config --global user.email <YOUR_EMAIL_HERE>`


I prefer VSCode to stage, and commit your changes. If you run into any issues while synching your commit, such as
"local branch has diverged from main" or something like that, do this:

`git pull --rebase`

then try synching again

*if you have any doubts, or would like some guidance, message the group on Slack!!!*
